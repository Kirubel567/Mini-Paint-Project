# Mini Paint - Vector Drawing Application

A real-time interactive 2D vector drawing application built with Python, OpenGL, and GLFW.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pythonmain.py
```

For keyboard shortcuts, see [QUICK_REFERENCE.txt](QUICK_REFERENCE.txt)

## Features

- **Drawing Tools**: Lines, Polylines, Regular Polygons
- **Transformations**: Translate, Rotate, Scale shapes
- **Selection**: Click to select and manipulate shapes
- **Colors**: 7 colors with quick cycling
- **Real-time**: 60 FPS OpenGL rendering

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- OpenGL 3.3+ capable graphics hardware

## What You Can Do

1. **Draw Shapes**
   - Lines (2 clicks)
   - Polylines (multiple clicks, finish with Enter/Right-click)
   - Polygons (3-12 sides, configurable)

2. **Edit Shapes**
   - Select by clicking
   - Move with Translation
   - Rotate around center
   - Scale (uniform or non-uniform)

3. **Customize**
   - Change polygon sides with P (direct input) or [ / ]
   - Cycle colors with C
   - Delete with Delete key

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| 1-5 | Select tool |
| P | Set polygon sides (new!) |
| [ / ] | Adjust polygon sides |
| T / R / S | Transform modes |
| C | Cycle color |
| Del | Delete shape |
| Esc | Cancel |
